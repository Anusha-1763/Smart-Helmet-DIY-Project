# Smart-Helmet-DIY-Project
The thought of developing this project came from social responsibility towards society. As we can see many accidents occur around us. Usually, people die due to a lack of treatment at the proper time. The reasons for this may be many such as the late arrival of the ambulance, and the person at the place of the accident to give information to the ambulance. We came up with the idea of providing the information about the accident as soon as possible and on time. So we can minimize death rate in bike accidents. We placed vibration sensors in different places of helmets where the probability of hitting is more which are connected to the Arduino board. So when the rider crashes and the helmet hits the ground, the sensors sense and the Arduino extract GPS data using the GPS module that is interfaced with Arduino. When the data exceeds the minimum stress limit then the GSM module automatically sends messages to ambulance or police or family members with GPS location.
